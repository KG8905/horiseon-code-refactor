The name of this challenge is horiseon- code-refactor.
Horiseon is a company that offers services that help businesses with marketing needs. They also extend their services to help businesses with their social media presence for their brand.
I used the help of my classmates, google, W3 schools as resources.
They challenges I faced were mostly that they examples were made for windows and not Mac. So I had to fisgure out the equivalent sometimes to make it work. I would get stuck a lot of the time because of that.
